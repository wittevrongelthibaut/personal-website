## üìù About the event

During my internship at delaware, I had the opportunity to present a workshop at the delaware Technology Event. The delaware Technology Event is an event where delaware employees can learn about new technologies and where they can participate in workshops to learn more about these technologies.

## ü™ö Preparing the workshop

The workshop I presented was about WDI5. What is WDI5, you might ask? WDI5 is an application testing framework that is used to test SAP Fiori applications. The goal of this workshop was to show the participants WDI5 exists and how to use it.

To prepare for this workshop, I had to create a presentation and a demo application. The presentation covered the entire workshop and steps that the participants had to follow to complete the workshop. The demo application was used to have a hands-on experience with WDI5.

## ü§© The day of the event

During the day of the event, I was a bit nervous, since it was my first time presenting a workshop. But during the day, my internship mentor and I had some time to prepare for the workshop and to make sure everything was ready. This gave me a lot of confidence and made me less nervous.

When the workshop started, I was still a bit nervous, but after a while, I got the hang of it and I was able to present the workshop without any problems. The participants were very interested in the workshop and asked a lot of questions. This made the workshop very interactive and fun to present.

## üç∫ After the workshop

After the workshop, we had some time to network with the participants and the other people that attended the event. This was very nice to do since I got to know a lot of new people from delaware and I got to know more about the company.

## ü§î Conclusion

I am very happy that I had the opportunity to present a workshop at the delaware Technology Event. It was a very fun and learning experience. Also, learning about WDI5 was very interesting, it is a technology that I will definitely look into more in the future.
