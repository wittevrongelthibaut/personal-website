## üöÇ The way there

Together with some fellow students from Howest, we went to the Dell Technology Forum in Brussels. The event started in the afternoon so we took a train around 11:00 to go to Brussels. When we arrived in Brussels it took a bit of looking around before we found the shuttle bus that would take us to the venue. But we arrived on time and were ready to attend the event.

## The Event

Firstly, we went to the reception to retrieve our lanyards and place our backpack in a safe place. After that, we went to the main hall where we could network with other people and where we could get some food and drinks.

Here we talked to a lady from VMware who told us about the company and what they do. She also told us about the different job opportunities they have. It was very interesting to hear about the different job opportunities they have and what they do.

After that, we went to the first talk of the day.

## üìù The Keynote

The first talk we attended was the keynote. In this keynote they talked about the future of cybersecurity and how we have to think differently about cybersecurity. Also they talked about Mercy Ships, a charity that helps people in need and how Dell Technologies helps them with their IT infrastructure.

## Back in the main hall

After the keynote, we went back to the main hall and found a booth from Cresco Cybersecurity. Here we talked about what they do and we even had the chance to see some life ethical hacking in action! It was very interesting to see how fast they can find information about you or your organisation.

## üìù Smart cooling

The next talk we attended was called 'Smart cooling'. In this talk, they talked about the innovations they made to make their datacenters and cooling systems more efficient. Since datacenters use a lot of energy, it is very important to make them as efficient as possible.
