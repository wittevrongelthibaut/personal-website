## üöÇ The way there

Together with some fellow students from Howest, we went to the Dell Technology Forum in Brussels. The event started in the afternoon, so we took a train around 11:00 to go to Brussels. When we arrived in Brussels, it took a bit of looking around before we found the shuttle bus that would take us to the venue. But we arrived on time and were ready to attend the event.

## The Event

Firstly, we went to the reception to retrieve our lanyards and place our backpack in a safe place. After that, we went to the main hall where we could network with other people and where we could get some food and drinks.

Here we talked to a lady from VMware who told us about the company and what they do. She also told us about the different job opportunities they have. It was very interesting to hear about the different job opportunities they have and what they do.

After that, we went to the first talk of the day.

## üìù The Keynote

The first talk we attended was the keynote. In this keynote, they talked about the future of cybersecurity and how we have to think differently about cybersecurity. Also, they talked about Mercy Ships, a charity that helps people in need and how Dell Technologies helps them with their IT infrastructure.

## Hacking action!

After the keynote, we went back to the main hall and found a booth from Cresco Cybersecurity. Here we talked about what they do, and we even had the chance to see some life ethical hacking in action! It was very interesting to see how fast they can find information about you or your organization.

## üìù Server and Data Center Innovation to Maintain High Performance

The next talk we attended was called 'Server and Data Center Innovation to Maintain High Performance'. In this talk, they talked about how they can cool down a server in a more efficient way. This was very interesting to see since I had never really seen anything like this during the courses on school.

## üìù Accelerating workloads to maximize your performance

The next talk we attended was called 'Accelerating workloads to maximize your performance'. In this talk, a sponsor of the event, Intel talked about new server processors. The presenter noticed we were students and even gave us a brief history on how the processors evolved over the years. Very interesting to see how everything changed over the years to achieve better performance!

## Of course Networking!

After the talks, we went back to the main hall to participate in the networking event. Here we talked to a lot of different companies and people involved in the tech industry. We even had the chance to drive in a F1 simulator! This was for sure a very fun experience! Reinaerd even managed to get the second-best time of the day!

## ü§î Conclusion

Overall, I had a very fun day at the Dell Technology Forum. I learned a lot of new things and concepts, and I had the chance to network with a lot of different people.
